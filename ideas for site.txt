1. WORRIES.FEARS on 'About Me' 
	-Going to school
	-Not getting to design festival structures:
		one of my greatest worries is being distracted in life, being misguided, not being able to live my passions because I made the wrong choices. I don't want to grow old with regret, seeing that I wasted my time. What time have I wasted up until this point? What would I have done differently? I don't really feel that I wasted much, because I am always aligning with the goal, or trying to find it. 
	One worry that I have is that I won't be able to build amazing structures for festivals. This is one of my main goals, after all. It makes me feel good to come back and look at my goals, to align myself with my purpose. What are some of the goals I used to keep on my wall, or on my goal cards? 
	1. Build festival structures
		-take one or two classes per semester of math or whatever
	2. Live in Barcelona
	3. Träffa många tjejer
	4. Live on the East Coast
	5. Live in my van
	6. Throw an event where I DJ
		-What steps can I take towards this?	
			-DJ more
			-Get some speakers
			-Find a location
			-Find some people who will want to come
			-research laws 
			-Make more friends
	7. Start a costume/sewing business
		steps to take-
			-sew stuff once a month
			-make backpacks
			-have a sewing station set up at moms house in the garage
			-dye cloths so that you have them ready to sew
			
	8. Draw naked girls
		steps to take
			-take time to do some drawing every day. Tie it to some activity, like finishing up work for the day, This way you can be at least living one of your passions once per day. 
	9. Get a bachelors degree	
		steps to take
			-take a couple classes per semester
			-sign up for classes when youre done with web dev classes
			-go out and be free, live and travel around, so that you can feel like you had some fun, and do lots of the other things you want to do, so that when you have to commit to school, you wont be committing another huge chunk of your life, when youve already spent so much time doing stuff you didnt really want to do.
			-remember Ingrid the threapist 






2. Your website is going to be for yourself, to align yourself with your goals. It's going to be a map for you. It's going to show you where you've been, and it's going to show you where you want to go. It's going to give you direction, and remind you what you are doing things for. 
	- It's going to remind you what you are doing in life, and why you are doing it. When you are confused and lost, it's going to remind you. When you feel weak, it's going to show you how badass you are. 

3. My idea of paradise, and my plan to make it so:
-Build festival structures
	a. Volunteer to build structures at lucidity for free. Show Ben and Meta what your plans are, and let them let you build some awesome shit
	b. when you build awesome structure at lucidity, bring pictures and add them to your web portfolio, then offer to build them at other festivals for free. 
	c. Build structures in your backyard, to show people at festivals what you can do
	d. Design plans for festival structures. Make CAD Drawings. Make things that show people that you can make incredible shit. 
		- tapestries that you've sewed yourself on your festival structures 

4. Who do you want to be? Who do you want to be around? What do you want your house to look like? 
	- be a colorful, musical, fun guy. Be singing songs and living in a COOL  Environment.
	- Be surrounded by images, art, and stuff that you put up on the walls, reminding you how awesome life is. Have an incredible room, home, etc. 
	- have a large property where you can have a workshop, where you can be away from people, where  you can build structures, where you can go into nature.
